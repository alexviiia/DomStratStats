Usage: perl -w $0 <input table> <output table> [<Pfam-A.hmm.dat>]

The required inputs are
    <input table>    the output from hmmscan (previous script).
    <output table>   input with some domains removed. Format is identical to input.

This is an additional optional input, which is specific to Pfam.
    <Pfam-A.hmm.dat> only used to identify domains that may nest.

Input files may be compressed with gzip, and may be specified with or without the .gz 
extension.  Output file will be automatically compressed with gzip.

See the online manual for more info.
