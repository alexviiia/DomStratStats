Usage: perl -w $0 <FASTA input> <input table> <output table> \\
         [<q-value> <local FDR> <FDR|lFDR>]

The required inputs are
    <FASTA input>  the FASTA sequence file, used to count all proteins.
    <input table>  the output from 1noOvs.pl (previous script).
    <output table> every input line has three columns added (unless thresolds are set).

The following optional thresholds may be set. Either or all can be set simultaneously, 
    which is supported although it is unusual and hard to interpret, so avoid using this 
    feature. Use 1 for any threshold you don't wish to set but must list (for example, to 
    only set an FDR|lFDR threshold, set both the q-value and local FDR thresholds to 1).
    <q-value>      stratified domain q-value threshold. Sets FDR per family.
    <local FDR>    stratified domain local FDR threshold. Sets minimum posterior error
                   probability per family.
    <FDR|lFDR>     threshold on combined FDR across domain families implied by a stratified
                   domain local FDR threshold. Sets a stratified domain local FDR threshold 
                   indirectly, by specifying the resulting combined FDR instead.

Input files may be compressed with gzip, and may be specified with or without the .gz 
extension.  Output file will be automatically compressed with gzip.
