Usage: perl -w $0 <FASTA input> <input table> <output table> \\ 
         <seq q-value> [<dom q-value>]

The required inputs are
    <FASTA input>  the FASTA sequence file, used to count all proteins.
    <input table>  the output from 1noOvs.pl (previous script).
    <output table> every input line that passes thresholds has two columns added.
    <seq q-value>  stratified sequence q-value threshold. Sets the desired FDR at the
                   sequence level, which can be interpreted as the FDR of calling proteins
                   as having at least one member of a given domain family. This threshold
                   is mandatory because they define conditional domain q-values. If no 
                   domain q-value threshold is set, then this same value is applied to 
                   conditional domain q-values, in which case the domain FDR 
                   (unconditionally) is approximately twice the q-value threshold passed.

You can optionally specify a domain q-value threshold that differs from the sequence
q-value threshold.
    <dom q-value>  threshold on the stratified domain q-value computed conditionally on the 
                   sequence threshold. The expected domain FDR (unconditionally) is 
                   approximately the sum of the sequence and domain q-value thresholds.

Input files may be compressed with gzip, and may be specified with or without the .gz 
extension.  Output file will be automatically compressed with gzip.
